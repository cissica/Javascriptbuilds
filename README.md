# Javascriptbuilds
Some Javascript based projects created during my Javascript course, including;
- A weather app, which uses a weather api to get weather information about the location entered by the user. 
- A chatroom app, which posts the message entered by the user into the chatroom. 
- A Javascript quiz app that checks answers chosen by the user and displays the score
